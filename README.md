# mdq-server

## MDQ Server Using Shibboleth MDA

This project is a reference implementation of the
[Metadata Query Protocol](https://github.com/iay/md-query)
based on the [Shibboleth Metadata Aggregator](https://shibboleth.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MA1/overview)
technology.

The intention is to help debug the MDQ specification during its development, but as much as makes sense of
the software developed here will be contributed to the main line Shibboleth MDA codebase once mature.

If you're feeling particularly adventurous, an image constructed from the very
latest push to this repository can be found
[on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ianayoung/mdq-server).
