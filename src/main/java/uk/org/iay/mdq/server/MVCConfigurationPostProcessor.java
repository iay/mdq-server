/**
 * Spring's default behavior is to decode the URL passed to it by the
 * container, and then parse the path into components on "/" characters.
 * This means you can't use URL-encoded "/" characters (%2f) within
 * identifiers.
 * 
 * <p>
 * See, for example, <a href="https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-11101">
 * SPR-11101</a>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To fix this, poke the bean responsible until it does what we want.
 * Fortunately, the implementation looks at the appropriate properties
 * on every request so we can do this even after the application has started.
